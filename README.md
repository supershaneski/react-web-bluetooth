react-web-bluetooth
================

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This is a sample application using the experimental (at this point) [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API). The project is based on the sample application described [here](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/scan.html).

Current, it does not do much. It will just scan for the nearby bluetooth devices and put it in a list. This is a work in progress. I might add more functions later on.
